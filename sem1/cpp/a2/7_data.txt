The domestic cat has a long and powerfully built body. 
Males are about 28 inches (71 centimeters) long. 
Females are about 20 inches (51 centimeters) long. 
Large eyes help the cat to see well at night. 
Its triangular ears can turn quickly toward the source of a sound. 
Four rows of stiff whiskers grow on each side of the nose. 
These give the cat a delicate sense of touch.
