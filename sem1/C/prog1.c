// 1. displaying the first ten numbers in the Fibonacci series.

// Problem 2 :​

// If  a natural number is a square number, then it has to be​

//       the sum of Successive Odd Numbers starting from 1. ​

// Develop a flowchart to express the logic for displaying the first ten numbers in the series of such square nos.​

// Represent the logic in the form of an algorithm which accepts the count of such numbers as input, and displays  each such square numbers along with its constituents.​

// Finally write the C-code for the problem and execute it.


// Problem 3:​

// If the sum of cubes of each digit of a number is equal to the number itself, then the number is called an Armstrong number. ​

//       For example, 153 = ( 13 ) + ( 53) + ( 33). ​

// Develop a flowchart to express the logic for displaying all such numbers between 1 and 500.​

// Represent the logic in the form of an algorithm which accepts the limit, and displays  each such number.​

// Finally write the C-code for the problem and execute it.


// [ARRAY: Problem 4]     Write a program in C to read n number of values in an array. After that, count a total number of duplicate elements in that array. Then copy the elements except the duplicate elements of that array into another array and display this array in reverse order.​

// ​

// [ARRAY: Problem 5]     Generate all prime numbers below 100. Count them.​

// ​

// [ARRAY: Problem 6]      Display the factors of all composite  numbers below 20 in a tabular form.
